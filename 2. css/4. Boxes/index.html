    <p>
        This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
        On the left, you can see two boxes whose contents expand beyond their set dimensions. The first example has the
        overflow property with a value of hidden. The second example has the overflow property with a value of scroll.
        The overflow property is particularly handy because some browsers allow users to adjust the size of the text to
        appear as large or as small as they want. If the text is set too large then the page can become an unreadable
        mess. Hiding the overflow on such boxes helps prevent items overlapping on the page.
